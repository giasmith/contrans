Specifically, the bill provides funding for the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to (1) assist agricultural producers with the costs of crop nutrient use or adopting precision agriculture practices, and (2) provide grants to eligible entities (e.g., fueling and distribution facilities) for biofuel infrastructure. The bill establishes within USDA the Office of the Special Investigator for Competition Matters, which must investigate and prosecute violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 by packers and live poultry dealers. Additionally, USDA must (1) establish an agriculture and food supply chain task force, and (2) provide assistance to address fertilizer shortages and reduce dependency on foreign sources for fertilizer. The bill allows USDA to make loans and grants for livestock and poultry processing. Further, the bill incorporates support for precision agriculture into various USDA programs. USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service must enter into certain cooperative agreements for establishing supply chain regional resource centers to support small- and medium-sized producers of agricultural products and agricultural businesses. The bill also applies the Reid vapor pressure (a measure of gasoline's volatility) requirements that are applicable to gasoline blended with 10% ethanol (E10) to gasoline blended with more than 10% ethanol. Thus, the waiver given to E10 gasoline, which allows an increase in the Reid Vapor Pressure volatility, is extended to gasoline blended with more than 10% ethanol. \",\n",

The bill also automatically grants emergency use authorization for rapid tests approved by certain foreign regulators. Specifically, HHS must purchase a sufficient quantity of rapid tests to provide two tests per week at no cost to each resident for the 12 months following the bill's enactment. The President may use authorities available under the Defense Production Act of 1950 to obtain the tests. That act confers upon the President a broad set of authorities to influence domestic industry in order to provide essential materials and goods needed for the national defense. In addition, HHS must conduct outreach about the availability of free rapid tests to Medicare and Medicaid participants and make the tests available through those programs. The bill also automatically grants emergency use authorization during the public health emergency for rapid tests that are listed for emergency use by (1) the World Health Organization (WHO), or (2) a foreign regulator that is a stringent regulatory authority as defined by the WHO for purposes of medicine procurement. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may rescind authority for, or otherwise regulate, a rapid test that was automatically authorized. Additionally, the FDA must establish a permanent advisory committee focused on diagnostic and serological testing for public health needs.\",\n",

Next, the bill establishes Election Day as a federal holiday. The bill establishes certain federal criminal offenses related to voting. In particular, the bill establishes a new criminal offense for conduct (or attempted conduct) to corruptly hinder, interfere with, or prevent another person from registering to vote or helping someone register to vote. Additionally, the bill sets forth provisions related to election security, including by requiring states to conduct post-election audits for federal elections. The bill outlines criteria for congressional redistricting and generally prohibits mid-decade redistricting. The bill addresses campaign finance, including by expanding the prohibition on campaign spending by foreign nationals and establishing an alternative campaign funding system for certain federal offices. Next, the bill establishes new criteria for determining which states and political subdivisions must obtain preclearance before changes to voting practices may take effect. Preclearance is the process of receiving preapproval from the Department of Justice or the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia before making legal changes that would affect voting rights.

This bill allows a compounder not registered with the FDA to compound drugs in limited quantities for urgent medical need not involving a specific patient if, among other things, (1) the prescriber certifies that they are unable to obtain, despite reasonable attempts, certain related drugs with the same active ingredient and route of administration; (2) the compounded drug meets certain labeling requirements, including an indication that the compounded drug is provided only for urgent administration to a patient; and (3) the compounder requests and maintains certain records about patients receiving the compounded drug. Furthermore, a restriction against an unregistered compounder regularly compounding (or compounding inordinate amounts of) what is essentially a copy of a commercially available drug shall not apply if the drug is on a shortage list maintained by the FDA or the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists.

The term does not include a time out, which may involve separating the student from others in a non-locked setting. The bill prohibits the use of mechanical or chemical restraints or physical restraints that restrict breathing or are life threatening. The bill outlines the requirements for the use of physical restraint, including that the student's behavior must pose an imminent danger of serious physical injury to the student or other individual. Each state must ensure that a sufficient number of program personnel are trained and certified by a state-approved crisis intervention training program. Additionally, each program must establish procedures to follow after an incident involving physical restraint. Further, the bill establishes enforcement provisions, including a private right of action for a student who has been subjected to unlawful seclusion or restraint. The Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services must withhold payments from a program for unlawful seclusion or restraint. Finally, the bill requires each state educational agency (SEA) to establish, implement, and enforce policies and procedures required by the bill. It also creates a grant program to assist SEAs with these activities.\",\n",

Specifically, the bill applies the liability protection to claims arising from third-party speech rather than third-party information. Additionally, the liability protection shall not apply if a user or provider (1) accepts payment to make the speech available, or (2) creates or funds (in whole or in part) the speech.  The bill changes legal procedures concerning the liability protection by (1) requiring a defendant in a lawsuit to raise the liability protection as an affirmative defense, and (2) placing the burden of proving that the defense applies on the defendant. Some courts have held that the current liability protection bars claims for civil penalties and injunctive relief. The bill expressly excludes from the liability protection requests for injunctive relief arising from a provider's failure to remove, restrict access to, or prevent dissemination of material likely to cause irreparable harm. However, the bill protects a provider from liability for actions taken to comply with such injunctions. Under current law, the liability protection does not apply to federal criminal law, intellectual property law, and other designated areas of law. The bill further specifies that the liability protection shall not apply to civil rights law; antitrust law; stalking, harassment, or intimidation laws; international human rights law; and civil actions for wrongful death.\",\n",

The bill also provides funds and establishes grants for states to create preschool programs for low- to moderate-income children between the ages of three and five years. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must make grants to Head Start agencies to provide children with access to full-school-year and full-school-day services, provide access to additional service hours for migrant and seasonal agencies, or enhance the quality of existing services.

Specifically, the bill establishes a presumption of service-connection for certain illnesses becoming manifest in covered veterans to a degree of 10% or more. Under a presumption of service-connection, specific conditions diagnosed in certain veterans are presumed to have been caused by the circumstances of their military service.

Among other elements, the bill   requires the VA to provide medical examinations for veterans who submit a claim for disability compensation for an illness not listed in the bill but that is asserted to be related to airborne hazard or open burn pit exposure; authorizes the VA to stay pending claims for disability compensation related to the service and illnesses covered by this bill until the implementation of the bill; and provides VA hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care to covered veterans. \",\n",

The bill (1) permits the complaining party to rely on any type or form of admissible evidence, which need only be sufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to find that an unlawful practice occurred; and (2) declares that the complaining party shall not be required to demonstrate that age or retaliation was the sole cause of the employment practice (thereby rejecting the Supreme Court's decision in Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., which requires the complainant to prove that age was the but-for cause for the employer's decision). The bill applies this evidentiary standard to other employment discrimination and retaliation claims, including claims under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In a claim in which age discrimination is shown, but where the employer demonstrates that it would have taken the same action absent the motivating factor of age, the bill authorizes courts to grant declaratory and injunctive relief, but prohibits the court from awarding damages or issuing an order requiring any admission, reinstatement, hiring, promotion, or payment. This limitation also applies to claims of discrimination based on disability. The bill also includes reporting requirements for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Labor.\",\n",

       "  'summary': \"Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2021 This bill expands various labor protections related to employees' rights to organize and collectively bargain in the workplace. Among other things, it (1) revises the definitions of employee, supervisor, and employer to broaden the scope of individuals covered by the fair labor standards; (2) permits labor organizations to encourage participation of union members in strikes initiated by employees represented by a different labor organization (i.e., secondary strikes); and (3) prohibits employers from bringing claims against unions that conduct such secondary strikes. The bill also allows collective bargaining agreements to require all employees represented by the bargaining unit to contribute fees to the labor organization for the cost of such representation, notwithstanding a state law to the contrary; and expands unfair labor practices to include prohibitions against replacement of, or discrimination against, workers who participate in strikes. The bill makes it an unfair labor practice to require or coerce employees to attend employer meetings designed to discourage union membership and prohibits employers from entering into agreements with employees under which employees waive the right to pursue or a join collective or class-action litigation. The bill further prohibits employers from taking adverse actions against an employee, including employees with management responsibilities, in response to that employee participating in protected activities related to the enforcement of the prohibitions against unfair labor practices (i.e., whistleblower protections). Such protected activities include  providing information about a potential violation to an enforcement agency, participating in an enforcement proceeding, initiating a proceeding concerning an alleged violation or assisting in such a proceeding, or refusing to participate in an activity the employee reasonably believes is a violation of labor laws.  Finally, the bill addresses the procedures for union representation elections, provides employees with the ability to vote in such elections remotely by telephone or the internet, modifies the protections against unfair labor practices that result in serious economic harm, and establishes penalties and permits injunctive relief against entities that fail to comply with National Labor Relations Board orders.  \",\n",

The bill restores school infrastructure tax credit bonds. The bill also sets forth reporting requirements, including annual reports on grant program projects and a report by the Government Accountability Office that requires a study of the geographic distribution of projects, the impact of projects on student and staff health and safety, and the accessibility of projects to high-poverty schools. Next, the bill extends through FY2026 the Impact Aid Construction program.

First, the bill expands the authority of, and provides funding for, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to provide special partition assistance to a multiemployer pension plan that is insolvent or at risk of insolvency. The bill expands eligibility for partition assistance, provides funding for a plan to reach a projected funded ratio of 80% over a 30-year period, and does not require a plan to repay such assistance. The bill further permits a multiemployer pension plan to elect to retain its funding zone status from the previous year for either (1) the first plan year beginning during the period from March 1, 2020, through February 28, 2021; or (2) the next succeeding plan year, as designated by the plan sponsor. A plan may also extend by five years the funding improvement or rehabilitation period if the plan is designated as in endangered or critical status for a plan year beginning in 2020 or 2021. A plan in critical and declining status may not suspend payment of plan benefits. Additionally, the bill adjusts the minimum funding standards for a multiemployer pension plan to account for investment losses and other losses related to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and modifies the PBGC guarantee formula to increase the maximum potential benefits under a multiemployer pension plan. Finally, the bill makes changes with respect to single employer pension plans, including revising the amortization rules and extending and modifying the pension funding stabilization percentages.',\n",

Further, the bill specifies that the disclaimer requirement applies to an agent whether the agent is within or outside the United States. Upon notification by the Department of Justice (DOJ), an online platform must remove any materials that do not meet disclaimer requirements and must use reasonable efforts to inform recipients of the materials that they were disseminated by an agent on behalf of a foreign principal.

Whereas we posthumously recognize the following Members of Congress, who served during and after the Reconstruction era, as honorary cosponsors of this resolution: the Honorable Joseph Hayne Rainey (SC–01), Member of Congress from 1870 to 1879, Jefferson Franklin Long (GA–04), Member of Congress from January 1871 to March 1871, Robert Carlos De Large (SC–02), Member of Congress from 1871 to 1873, Robert Brown Elliott (SC–3), Member of Congress from 1871 to 1874, Benjamin Sterling Turner (AL–01), Member of Congress from 1871 to 1873, Josiah Thomas Walls (FL-At Large), Member of Congress from 1871 to 1876, Alonzo Jacob Ransier (SC–02), Member of Congress from 1873 to 1875, Richard Harvey Cain (SC-At Large), Member of Congress from 1873 to 1875 and 1877 to 1879, John Roy Lynch (MS–06), Member of Congress from 1873 to 1877 and 1882 to 1883, James Thomas Rapier (AL–02), Member of Congress from 1873 to 1875, Jeremiah Haralson (AL–01), Member of Congress from 1875 to 1877, John Adams Hyman (NC–02), Member of Congress from 1875 to 1877, Robert Smalls (SC–07), Member of Congress from 1875 to 1879 and 1882 to 1883 and 1884 to 1887, James Edward O’Hara (NC–02), Member of Congress from 1883 to 1887, Henry Plummer Cheatham (NC–02), Member of Congress from 1889 to 1893, John Mercer Langston (VA–04), Member of Congress from 1890 to 1891, Thomas Ezekiel Miller, Member of Congress from 1890 to 1891, George Washington Murray (SC–01), Member of Congress from 1893 to 1895 and 1896 to 1897, and George Henry White (NC–02), Member of Congress from 1897 to 1901; Whereas, on August 20, 1619, the first 20 enslaved Africans were brought to what is now Fort Monroe, then Point Comfort, in Hampton, Virginia against their will; Whereas the House of Representatives and the Senate recognize August 20th, as Slavery Remembrance Day and commemorate the lives of all enslaved people while also condemning the act and perpetuation of slavery in the United States of America and across the world; Whereas African tribal chiefs captured, enslaved, and sold their captives to transatlantic slave traders; Whereas, over the period of the Atlantic slave trade, from approximately 1526 to 1867, millions of humans were abducted and shipped from Africa, and 10,700,000 arrived in the Americas as personal property; Whereas the majority of enslaved Africans brought to British North America arrived between 1720 and 1780; Whereas about 6 percent of African captives were sent directly to British North America; Whereas, by 1825, the population of the United States included about one quarter of the people of African descent in what has been called the New World; Whereas the Middle Passage from West Africa to the West Indies was dangerous and horrific for enslaved people; Whereas the Middle Passage carried mothers, fathers, children, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, cousins, and individuals from all walks of life to slavery in the Americas; Whereas, although the sexes were separated, men, women, and children were kept naked, packed close together, and the men were chained for long periods; Whereas, according to some historians, about 12 percent of those who embarked did not survive the voyage; Whereas sharks followed the slave ships to feed on bodies of slaves thrown overboard; Whereas enslaved people suffered a variety of miserable and often fatal maladies due to the Atlantic slave trade, and to inhumane living and working conditions; Whereas infant and child mortality rates were twice as high among slave children as among Southern White children; Whereas enslaved people often worked from before sunup to after sundown, 6 to 7 days a week often without food for long periods of time; Whereas enslaved Black families lived with the perpetual possibility of separation caused by the sale of one or more family members; Whereas it is estimated that approximately one third of enslaved children in the upper South States of Maryland and Virginia experienced family separation in one of three possible scenarios: sale away from parents, sale with mother away from father, or sale of mother or father away from child; Whereas Nat Turner was born into slavery in Southampton County, Virginia, in 1800; Whereas Southampton County was home to many plantations, and enslaved people outnumbered free Whites; Whereas Turner learned to read and write at a young age, becoming deeply religious; Whereas Turner was sold to several different masters over the course of his life, the last time in 1830; Whereas Turner preached to his fellow enslaved people, developing a loyal following; Whereas Turner began planning a revolt with a few trusted fellow enslaved men from neighboring plantations; Whereas Turner’s rebellion began in August 1831, quickly growing from a small handful of enslaved individuals to more than 70 enslaved and free Blacks; Whereas the rebels went from house to house in Southampton County, freeing enslaved people; Whereas the rebels were ultimately defeated by a State militia that had over twice the manpower of the rebels, with three artillery companies reinforcing it; Whereas Turner was captured 6 weeks after the rebellion was put down, whereupon he was promptly convicted and sentenced to death; Whereas, in retaliation for the uprising, Virginia officially executed 56 Black people, with at least 100 more killed by militias through extrajudicial violence; Whereas the rebellion caused widespread panic among slaveholders throughout the South, resulting in widespread violence against enslaved people; Whereas, in the wake of the rebellion, the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation making it illegal to teach enslaved or free Blacks to read and write; Whereas the Underground Railroad was a network of individuals who helped around 100,000 slaves escape North; Whereas the railroad began when a conductor often posing as a slave would enter a plantation and attempt to guide runaways; Whereas escapees would travel 10 to 20 miles each night between safe houses or stations to avoid detection, waiting in safe houses for the next along the line to be alerted to their presence; Whereas individuals running each station, many of whom were White, knew only of local efforts and not the entire operation; Whereas Harriet Tubman, born Araminta Ross, lived as an enslaved person through her young life where she endured regular whippings and suffered a traumatic head injury at the hands of an overseer, causing her narcoleptic episodes and migraines throughout her life; Whereas Ms. Tubman escaped from slavery along the Underground Railroad, a network of abolitionists who guided escaped slaves to the North traveling primarily at night to avoid bounty hunters; Whereas Ms. Tubman returned to the South no less than 13 times to free 70 enslaved persons, including much of her family, for which she would be given the name Moses; Whereas Ms. Tubman deftly led those she saved North during the fall and winter when their would-be captors stayed inside to avoid the cold; Whereas, in Ms. Tubman’s own words, I never ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger; Whereas, during the Civil War, Ms. Tubman served as a nurse, scout, and spy in the Union army, becoming the first woman to plan and lead a military operation in the United States, liberating 700 enslaved people in South Carolina; Whereas, later in life, Ms. Tubman continued working to improve the lives of oppressed people, raising funds for and building schools as well as a hospital in the name of formerly enslaved people while participating in the women’s suffrage movement; Whereas John Brown, an abolitionist who ran an important stop on the Underground Railroad, dedicated his life to ending slavery; Whereas Brown lead a militia in guerrilla attacks on proslavery towns in Kansas, losing one of his sons in the struggle; Whereas Brown, with the help of Harriet Tubman, planned and organized an invasion of the South to free all slaves; Whereas Brown began his invasion at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, but was surrounded and captured by Federal troops led by Robert E. Lee, losing two more sons in the fighting; Whereas the 13th Amendment was passed by Congress on January 31, 1865, and ratified on December 6, 1865, and provides that Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.; Whereas, beginning in the 20th century, African Americans began to relocate from Southern farms to Southern cities, from the South to the Northeast, Midwest, and West, in a movement known as the Great Migration; Whereas the relocation of formerly enslaved individuals and their descendants also included unfavorable and at times unjust interactions with law enforcement that often resulted in imprisonment and convict leasing; Whereas convict leasing, also known as slavery by another name, was a system that allowed prisons to lease imprisoned individuals to private entities, often corporations and plantations; Whereas the remains of 95 persons, thought to be of African ancestry, who were subjected to the convict leasing system in the State of Texas were discovered in 2018 at the construction site of Fort Bend Independent School District’s James Reese Career and Technical Center in Sugar Land, Texas; Whereas, while slavery was abolished, descendants of the enslaved continue to live with the effects of slavery’s progenies: Jim Crow, mass lynching, segregation, police brutality, mass incarceration, and institutionalized racism; and Whereas, despite the horrors of slavery and against all odds, enslaved people became thought leaders and revolutionaries and changed the course of American history: Now, therefore, be it This resolution may be cited as the Original Slavery Remembrance Day Resolution. That the House of Representatives and the Senate— designate a Slavery Remembrance Day annually to serve as a reminder of the evils of slavery;  condemn slavery and its evil progenies;  encourage all to acknowledge the importance of slavery remembrance; and authorize and request the President to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe such days with appropriate ceremonies and activities.',\n",

Whereas the Constitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) reminds us that a peace based exclusively upon the political and economic arrangements of Governments would not be a peace which could secure the unanimous, lasting and sincere support of the peoples of the world, and the peace must therefore be founded, if it is not to fail, upon the intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind; Whereas the 2020 Global Peace Index found that peacefulness declined for the ninth time in 12 years, with 80 countries showing declining peacefulness scores; Whereas the 2020 Global Peace Index also noted that global violence cost $14.5 trillion in 2019; Whereas strengthening and supporting domestic and global efforts to study, discuss, teach, and develop techniques and methods to encourage and augment global peace efforts is a critical international goal; Whereas, on November 30, 1981, during the 77th plenary meeting, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution to declare the third Tuesday of September as the International Day of Peace; Whereas nearly 20 years later, the United Nations General Assembly adopted A/RES/55/282, which officially designated September 21 as a global day to recognize and celebrate international cease-fire and nonviolence; Whereas, in 2001, the United Nations Economic and Social Council Organization proclaimed November 10 as World Science Day for Peace and Development; Whereas, on February 24, 2003, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring each May 29th as International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers, recognizing the significant sacrifices people have made and continue to make in pursuit of peace; Whereas, on December 22, 2005, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring December 20th International Human Solidarity Day and defined solidarity as a fundamental and universal value underlying modern human relations; Whereas, on June 15, 2007, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring October 2 as International Day of Non-Violence, extolling the virtues of nonviolent action such as protests, marches, vigils, and other acts of peaceful resistance; Whereas, on August 19, 2013, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring April 6th as the International Day of Sport for Development and Peace; Whereas, on February 2, 2017, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring December 12 as International Day of Neutrality; Whereas, on January 15, 2018, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring May 16 as International Day of Living Together in Peace, and affirmed that, in order to accomplish the goal of peace, we must eliminate all forms of discrimination and intolerance; Whereas, on December 12, 2018, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring April 24th International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace, recognizing that peace requires good-faith cooperation; Whereas, on July 25, 2019, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring April 5th as the International Day of Conscience in order to mobiliz[e] the efforts of the international community to promote peace, tolerance, inclusion, understanding and solidarity, in order to build a sustainable world of peace, solidarity and harmony; Whereas attaining peace involves the active and persistent process of persuading people of the benefits of peace, cooperation, tolerance, and nonviolence; Whereas peace is only attainable via a sustained commitment by a critical mass of those striving to do good; and Whereas peace is a global goal that can only be achieved through thoughtful, deliberative, cooperative actions that center peace as their primary objective: Now, therefore, be it That Congress— recognizes the— 40th anniversary of the International Day of Peace; 20th anniversary of the International Day of Peace being recognized as a period of nonviolence and cease-fire; 20th anniversary of the World Science Day for Peace and Development; 18th anniversary of the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers; 16th anniversary of Human Solidarity Day; 14th anniversary of the International Day of Non-Violence; 8th anniversary of the International Day of Sport for Development and Peace; 4th anniversary of the International Day of Neutrality; 3d anniversary of the International Day of Living Together in Peace; 3d anniversary of the International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace; and 2d anniversary of the International Day of Conscience; and commits to— encouraging the people of the United States to continue commemorating international days of peace, coexistence, and cooperation; supporting activities on international days of peace, coexistence, and cooperation that promote thoughtful, deliberative, and cooperative actions to achieve peace; and facilitating the application of peace, tolerance, cease-fire, and nonviolence throughout the year.',\n",

       "  'bill_text': 'Whereas the preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says that disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of humankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people; Whereas the Constitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) reminds us that a peace based exclusively upon the political and economic arrangements of Governments would not be a peace which could secure the unanimous, lasting and sincere support of the peoples of the world, and the peace must therefore be founded, if it is not to fail, upon the intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind; Whereas the 2020 Global Peace Index found that peacefulness declined for the ninth time in 12 years, with 80 countries showing declining peacefulness scores; Whereas the 2020 Global Peace Index also noted that global violence cost $14.5 trillion in 2019; Whereas strengthening and supporting domestic and global efforts to study, discuss, teach, and develop techniques and methods to encourage and augment global peace efforts is a critical international goal; Whereas, on November 30, 1981, during the 77th plenary meeting, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution to declare the third Tuesday of September as the International Day of Peace; Whereas nearly 20 years later, the United Nations General Assembly adopted A/RES/55/282, which officially designated September 21 as a global day to recognize and celebrate international cease-fire and nonviolence; Whereas, in 2001, the United Nations Economic and Social Council Organization proclaimed November 10 as World Science Day for Peace and Development; Whereas, on February 24, 2003, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring each May 29th as International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers, recognizing the significant sacrifices people have made and continue to make in pursuit of peace; Whereas, on December 22, 2005, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring December 20th International Human Solidarity Day and defined solidarity as a fundamental and universal value underlying modern human relations; Whereas, on June 15, 2007, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring October 2 as International Day of Non-Violence, extolling the virtues of nonviolent action such as protests, marches, vigils, and other acts of peaceful resistance; Whereas, on August 19, 2013, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring April 6th as the International Day of Sport for Development and Peace; Whereas, on February 2, 2017, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring December 12 as International Day of Neutrality; Whereas, on January 15, 2018, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring May 16 as International Day of Living Together in Peace, and affirmed that, in order to accomplish the goal of peace, we must eliminate all forms of discrimination and intolerance; Whereas, on December 12, 2018, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring April 24th International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace, recognizing that peace requires good-faith cooperation; Whereas, on July 25, 2019, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring April 5th as the International Day of Conscience in order to mobiliz[e] the efforts of the international community to promote peace, tolerance, inclusion, understanding and solidarity, in order to build a sustainable world of peace, solidarity and harmony; Whereas attaining peace involves the active and persistent process of persuading people of the benefits of peace, cooperation, tolerance, and nonviolence; Whereas peace is only attainable via a sustained commitment by a critical mass of those striving to do good; and Whereas peace is a global goal that can only be achieved through thoughtful, deliberative, cooperative actions that center peace as their primary objective: Now, therefore, be it That Congress— recognizes the— 40th anniversary of the International Day of Peace; 20th anniversary of the International Day of Peace being recognized as a period of nonviolence and cease-fire; 20th anniversary of the World Science Day for Peace and Development; 18th anniversary of the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers; 16th anniversary of Human Solidarity Day; 14th anniversary of the International Day of Non-Violence; 8th anniversary of the International Day of Sport for Development and Peace; 4th anniversary of the International Day of Neutrality; 3d anniversary of the International Day of Living Together in Peace; 3d anniversary of the International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace; and 2d anniversary of the International Day of Conscience; and commits to— encouraging the people of the United States to continue commemorating international days of peace, coexistence, and cooperation; supporting activities on international days of peace, coexistence, and cooperation that promote thoughtful, deliberative, and cooperative actions to achieve peace; and facilitating the application of peace, tolerance, cease-fire, and nonviolence throughout the year.',\n",

If a committee fails to report the joint committee bill within that period, it shall be in order to move that the House discharge the committee from further consideration of the bill. Such a motion shall not be in order after the last committee authorized to consider the bill reports it to the House or after the House has disposed of a motion to discharge the bill. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to its adoption without intervening motion except 20 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent. If such a motion is adopted, House shall proceed immediately to consider the bill in accordance with this subsection. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is disposed of shall not be in order. After the last committee authorized to consider a joint committee bill reports it to the House or has been discharged (other than by motion) from its consideration, it shall be in order to move to proceed to consider the joint committee bill in the House. Such a motion shall not be in order after the House has disposed of a motion to proceed with respect to the joint committee bill.

The vote on passage of the joint committee bill shall occur not later than 7 session days after being reported. A joint committee bill introduced in the Senate under subsection (a) shall be referred to the committee or committees of jurisdiction, which committees shall report the bill without any revision and with a favorable recommendation, an unfavorable recommendation, or without recommendation, not later than 7 session days. If any committee fails to report the bill within that period, that committee shall be automatically discharged from consideration of the bill, and the bill shall be placed on the appropriate calendar. Notwithstanding Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, it is in order, not later than 2 days of session after the date on which a joint committee bill is reported or on which Committee(s) are discharged from their consideration of the bill, for the majority leader of the Senate or the majority leader's designee to move to proceed to the consideration of the joint committee bill. It shall also be in order for any Member of the Senate to move to proceed to the consideration of the joint committee bill at any time after the conclusion of such 2-day period. All points of order against the motion to proceed to the joint committee bill are waived. The motion to proceed is not debatable. The motion is not subject to a motion to postpone.

Consideration of the joint committee bill and of all debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith shall not exceed a total of 30 hours which shall be divided equally between the majority and minority leaders or their designees. A motion further to limit debate on the joint committee bill is in order, shall require an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members duly chosen and sworn, and is not debatable. Any debatable motion or appeal is debatable for not to exceed 1 hour, to be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the motion or appeal. All time used for consideration of the joint committee bill, including time used for quorum calls and voting, shall be counted against the total 30 hours of consideration. An amendment to the joint committee bill, or a motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration of other business, or a motion to recommit the joint committee bill, is not in order. If the Senate has voted to proceed to the joint committee bill, the vote on passage of the joint committee bill shall occur immediately following the conclusion of the debate on a joint committee bill, and a single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if requested. The vote on passage of the committee bill shall occur not later than 7 session days. Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the rules of the Senate, as the case may be, to the procedure relating to a joint committee bill shall be decided without debate. The joint committee bill shall not be subject to amendment in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. If, before passing the Committee, one House receives from the other a joint committee bill— the joint committee bill of the other House not be referred to a committee; and the procedure in the receiving House shall be the same as if no joint committee bill had been received from the other House until the vote on passage, when the joint committee bill received from the other House shall supplant the joint committee bill of the receiving House. This subsection shall not apply to the House of Representatives if the joint committee bill received from the Senate is a revenue measure. If the Senate fails to introduce or consider a joint committee bill under this section, the joint committee bill of the House shall be entitled to expedited floor procedures under this section. If following passage of the joint committee bill in the Senate, the Senate then receives the joint committee bill from the House of Representatives, the House-passed joint committee bill shall not be debatable. The vote on passage of the joint committee bill in the Senate shall be considered to be the vote on passage of the joint committee bill received from the House of Representatives. If the President vetoes the joint committee bill, debate on a veto message in the Senate under this section shall be 1 hour equally divided between the majority and minority leaders or their designees. The provisions of this section shall cease to apply to the joint committee bill if— the Committee fails to vote on the report or proposed legislative language required under section 3 not later than 390 days after the date of enactment of this joint resolution; or  the joint committee bill does not pass both Houses not later than 180 days. The Committee shall terminate 30 days after submitting its final report. In this Act, the term appropriate congressional committees means— the Committees on Appropriations, Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, and Budget of the House of Representatives; and the Committees on Appropriations, Finance, Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and Budget of the Senate.\",\n",

       "  'bill_text': 'Whereas the people of the Republic of Sudan suffered for three decades under the despotic rule of President Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir, whose government was responsible for the suppression of civil liberties, grand corruption, support for international terrorism, and the commission of crimes against humanity and genocide; Whereas, throughout 2019, a coalition of Sudanese civic groups, including professional associations, labor unions, community groups, democracy activists, and opposition parties, led a mass protest movement to demand the end of Bashir’s reign and the transition to democracy in Sudan; Whereas, on April 11, 2019, Sudanese military officers deposed Bashir, and, following continued protests, agreed to form a transitional government in partnership with a civilian pro-democracy coalition on July 17, 2019; Whereas, on June 3, 2019, Sudanese forces led by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), largely comprised of Janjaweed militia involved in genocidal campaigns across Darfur for decades, opened fire on protesters at an army command headquarters in Khartoum, killing at least 127 people, at least 40 of whom were found in the Nile River; Whereas the military and civilian elements agreed to a 39-month transition to democracy, with a Civilian-Led Transitional Government (CLTG) comprised of a predominantly civilian cabinet led by Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok, a Sovereign Council, an executive body with civilian and military members chaired for the first half of the transitional period by Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and a Transitional Legislative Council, which has yet to be formed; Whereas the United States and the international community supported Sudan’s transition to democracy, with the United States identifying more than $1,000,000,000 in foreign assistance, and the multilateral Friends of Sudan group pledging $1,800,000,000 from roughly 50 countries and international organizations; Whereas the CLTG made progress in human rights reforms, including guaranteeing the people of Sudan freedom of religion and gender equality under the transitional constitution, banning female genital mutilation, and decriminalizing apostasy; Whereas, in August 2021, when the Sudanese Cabinet ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), the CLTG made progress towards ending impunity for abusers of human rights, stating its intention to deliver Omar al-Bashir to the ICC to stand trial for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, and formed civilian committees to investigate corruption and crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Bashir regime; Whereas the transitional government negotiated a peace agreement with several rebel groups, a step towards ending decades of conflict in the regions of Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile, which killed hundreds of thousands of civilians and left more than 3,000,000 people displaced within Sudan; Whereas Sudan continues to face a serious humanitarian situation, with an estimated 13,400,000 people, or 29 percent of the population, in need of humanitarian assistance in 2021; Whereas Sudan faces a severe economic crisis, exacerbated by the COVID–19 pandemic, which caused the price of food and consumer goods to increase significantly, while austerity measures imposed to stabilize the economy resulted in the reduction or elimination of subsidies for commodities including wheat and fuel; Whereas the political tensions between the civilian and military elements and within factions of the civilian coalition undermined the CLTG and contributed to widespread unrest within the Sudanese population relating to a range of issues, including the economic crisis, ethnic and tribal conflict in peripheral regions, and the unsatisfactory pace of reforms; Whereas, on September 21, 2021, some members of the military reportedly attempted a coup d’état against the transitional government, which failed to depose the government but succeeded in precipitating the most serious political crisis of the transition period; Whereas, on October 21, 2021, hundreds of thousands of people across Sudan demonstrated in support of democratic civilian rule, to counter a smaller protest days prior demanding the military take complete control of the government; Whereas, on October 25, 2021, Lieutenant General Burhan, with the support of General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, seized control of the government, deployed the military to the streets of Khartoum and Omdurman, and arrested and detained Prime Minister Hamdok and other civilian officials; Whereas the African Union Peace and Security Council convened on October 27, 2021, strongly condemned the coup, reaffirmed the mandate of the CLTG, and subsequently suspended Sudan from the regional body with immediate effect … until the effective restoration of the CLTG; Whereas the actions of Lieutenant General Burhan and the Sudanese military violate Sudan’s Constitutional Charter and threaten to plunge Sudan into isolation and instability; Whereas the United States Government publicly condemned the coup, suspended its foreign assistance to Sudan, and urged Lieutenant General Burhan and his accomplices to restore the CLTG and return Sudan to the path to democracy; and Whereas, the Troika (the United States, United Kingdom, Norway), the European Union, and Switzerland continue to recognize the Prime Minister and his cabinet as the constitutional leaders of the transitional government and confirm once again the international calls for the immediate return to the roadmap for democratic transition of Sudan: Now, therefore, be it That Congress— condemns the October 25, 2021, coup in Sudan; stands with the people of Sudan in their democratic aspirations; recognizes the Prime Minister and his cabinet as the constitutional leaders of Sudan’s transitional government; calls for Sudan’s military junta to— immediately release all civilian government officials, civil society members, and other individuals detained in connection with the coup; return to constitutional rule under the transitional constitution as the starting point for negotiations with civilians toward full civilian rule; lift the state of emergency, including complete restoration of all means of communication; remove all roadblocks and checkpoints, and order the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and RSF to stand down and comply with international recognized rules of engagement; ensure security forces respect the right to peaceful protest and hold those who used excessive force and committed other abuses accountable in a transparent, credible process; cease all attempts to change the civilian composition of the cabinet, Sovereign Council, and other government bodies; and transfer leadership of the Sovereign Council to a civilian member of the Sovereign Council in keeping with the transitional constitution; calls on the Secretary of State to— immediately identify coup leaders, their accomplices, and enablers for consideration for targeted sanctions; urge junta leaders to return immediately to the rule of law as set forth by the transitional constitution; monitor, discourage, and deter any effort by external parties to support the coup and the military junta; coordinate with— the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development and other Federal Government agencies to pause all non-humanitarian bilateral assistance to Sudan until restoration of the transitional constitutional order; the Department of the Treasury to use the voice and vote of the United States in international financial institutions to suspend all actions related to non-humanitarian loans or debt relief to Sudan until restoration of the transitional constitutional order; and the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to ensure the United Nations Security Council is seized of the matter on an ongoing basis; and work with the Troika to engage members of the international community to join these United States actions; and calls on international partners to— join United States efforts to impose targeted sanctions on the junta and other accomplices to the coup, monitor, discourage, and deter any effort by external parties to support the junta, and urge junta leaders to return to the rule of law as set forth by the transitional constitution; and suspend Sudan’s participation in all regional multilateral organizations until Sudan is returned to constitutional rule under the transitional constitution.

       "  'bill_text': 'Whereas the people of the Republic of Sudan suffered for three decades under the despotic rule of President Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir, whose government was responsible for the suppression of civil liberties, grand corruption, support for international terrorism, and the commission of crimes against humanity and genocide; Whereas, throughout 2019, a coalition of Sudanese civic groups, including professional associations, labor unions, community groups, democracy activists, and opposition parties, led a mass protest movement to demand the end of Bashir’s reign and the transition to democracy in Sudan; Whereas, on April 11, 2019, Sudanese military officers deposed Bashir, and, following continued protests, agreed to form a transitional government in partnership with a civilian pro-democracy coalition on July 17, 2019; Whereas, on June 3, 2019, Sudanese forces led by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), largely comprised of Janjaweed militia involved in genocidal campaigns across Darfur for decades, opened fire on protesters at an army command headquarters in Khartoum, killing at least 127 people, at least 40 of whom were found in the Nile River; Whereas the military and civilian elements agreed to a 39-month transition to democracy, with a Civilian-Led Transitional Government (CLTG) comprised of a predominantly civilian cabinet led by Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok, a Sovereign Council, an executive body with civilian and military members chaired for the first half of the transitional period by Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and a Transitional Legislative Council, which has yet to be formed; Whereas the United States and the international community supported Sudan’s transition to democracy, with the United States identifying more than $1,000,000,000 in foreign assistance, and the multilateral Friends of Sudan group pledging $1,800,000,000 from roughly 50 countries and international organizations; Whereas the CLTG made progress in human rights reforms, including guaranteeing the people of Sudan freedom of religion and gender equality under the transitional constitution, banning female genital mutilation, and decriminalizing apostasy; Whereas, in August 2021, when the Sudanese Cabinet ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), the CLTG made progress towards ending impunity for abusers of human rights, stating its intention to deliver Omar al-Bashir to the ICC to stand trial for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, and formed civilian committees to investigate corruption and crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Bashir regime; Whereas the transitional government negotiated a peace agreement with several rebel groups, a step towards ending decades of conflict in the regions of Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile, which killed hundreds of thousands of civilians and left more than 3,000,000 people displaced within Sudan; Whereas Sudan continues to face a serious humanitarian situation, with an estimated 13,400,000 people, or 29 percent of the population, in need of humanitarian assistance in 2021; Whereas Sudan faces a severe economic crisis, exacerbated by the COVID–19 pandemic, which caused the price of food and consumer goods to increase significantly, while austerity measures imposed to stabilize the economy resulted in the reduction or elimination of subsidies for commodities including wheat and fuel; Whereas the political tensions between the civilian and military elements and within factions of the civilian coalition undermined the CLTG and contributed to widespread unrest within the Sudanese population relating to a range of issues, including the economic crisis, ethnic and tribal conflict in peripheral regions, and the unsatisfactory pace of reforms; Whereas, on September 21, 2021, some members of the military reportedly attempted a coup d’état against the transitional government, which failed to depose the government but succeeded in precipitating the most serious political crisis of the transition period; Whereas, on October 21, 2021, hundreds of thousands of people across Sudan demonstrated in support of democratic civilian rule, to counter a smaller protest days prior demanding the military take complete control of the government; Whereas, on October 25, 2021, Lieutenant General Burhan, with the support of General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, seized control of the government, deployed the military to the streets of Khartoum and Omdurman, and arrested and detained Prime Minister Hamdok and other civilian officials; Whereas the African Union Peace and Security Council convened on October 27, 2021, strongly condemned the coup, reaffirmed the mandate of the CLTG, and subsequently suspended Sudan from the regional body with immediate effect … until the effective restoration of the CLTG; Whereas the actions of Lieutenant General Burhan and the Sudanese military violate Sudan’s Constitutional Charter and threaten to plunge Sudan into isolation and instability; Whereas the United States Government publicly condemned the coup, suspended its foreign assistance to Sudan, and urged Lieutenant General Burhan and his accomplices to restore the CLTG and return Sudan to the path to democracy; and Whereas, the Troika (the United States, United Kingdom, Norway), the European Union, and Switzerland continue to recognize the Prime Minister and his cabinet as the constitutional leaders of the transitional government and confirm once again the international calls for the immediate return to the roadmap for democratic transition of Sudan: Now, therefore, be it That Congress— condemns the October 25, 2021, coup in Sudan; stands with the people of Sudan in their democratic aspirations; recognizes the Prime Minister and his cabinet as the constitutional leaders of Sudan’s transitional government; calls for Sudan’s military junta to— immediately release all civilian government officials, civil society members, and other individuals detained in connection with the coup; return to constitutional rule under the transitional constitution as the starting point for negotiations with civilians toward full civilian rule; lift the state of emergency, including complete restoration of all means of communication; remove all roadblocks and checkpoints, and order the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and RSF to stand down and comply with international recognized rules of engagement; ensure security forces respect the right to peaceful protest and hold those who used excessive force and committed other abuses accountable in a transparent, credible process; cease all attempts to change the civilian composition of the cabinet, Sovereign Council, and other government bodies; and transfer leadership of the Sovereign Council to a civilian member of the Sovereign Council in keeping with the transitional constitution; calls on the Secretary of State to— immediately identify coup leaders, their accomplices, and enablers for consideration for targeted sanctions; urge junta leaders to return immediately to the rule of law as set forth by the transitional constitution; monitor, discourage, and deter any effort by external parties to support the coup and the military junta; coordinate with— the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development and other Federal Government agencies to pause all non-humanitarian bilateral assistance to Sudan until restoration of the transitional constitutional order; the Department of the Treasury to use the voice and vote of the United States in international financial institutions to suspend all actions related to non-humanitarian loans or debt relief to Sudan until restoration of the transitional constitutional order; and the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to ensure the United Nations Security Council is seized of the matter on an ongoing basis; and work with the Troika to engage members of the international community to join these United States actions; and calls on international partners to— join United States efforts to impose targeted sanctions on the junta and other accomplices to the coup, monitor, discourage, and deter any effort by external parties to support the junta, and urge junta leaders to return to the rule of law as set forth by the transitional constitution; and suspend Sudan’s participation in all regional multilateral organizations until Sudan is returned to constitutional rule under the transitional constitution.

Whereas over 5 decades after the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (29 U.S.C. 206 note), Census Bureau data show that women working full-time, year-round are paid an average of 82 cents for every dollar paid to men, while Asian-American women working full-time, year-round are paid 87 cents, White, non-Hispanic women working full-time, year-round are paid 79 cents, African-American women working full-time, year-round are paid 63 cents, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander women working full-time, year-round are paid 60 cents, American Indian and Alaska Native women working full-time, year-round are paid 60 cents, and Latinas working full-time, year-round are paid 55 cents for every dollar paid to White, non-Hispanic men; Whereas March 24, 2021, is Equal Pay Day, marking the day that symbolizes how long into 2021 women must work to make what men were paid in 2020; Whereas March 9, 2021, is Asian American and Pacific Islander Women’s Equal Pay Day; August 3, 2021, is Black Women’s Equal Pay Day; September 8, 2021, is Native Women’s Equal Pay Day; and October 21, 2021, is Latinas’ Equal Pay Day; Whereas if current trends continue, Asian women are projected to close the gender pay gap in 22 years, White women in 50 years, Black women in 350 years, and Latinas in 432 years; Whereas the disparity in median annual earnings for women and men working full-time, year-round is $10,157; which can add up to more than $400,000 over a career; Whereas women’s median earnings are less than men’s at every level of academic achievement, with women with less than a high school diploma earning 72 percent of men’s earnings, and women with a professional degree earning 68 percent of men’s earnings at the same level of education; Whereas women are often paid less than men with lower levels of education, with women with associate’s degrees paid less than men with a high school diploma, and women with master’s degrees paid less than men with bachelor’s degrees; Whereas in the United States, mothers are breadwinners in nearly half of families with children under 18, and mothers working full-time typically are paid 75 percent of what fathers are paid; Whereas the gender wage gap collectively costs women employed full-time in the United States more than $956 billion in annual lost wages, so that families have less money to spend on goods and services that help drive economic growth; Whereas if the annual gender wage gap were eliminated, on average, a working woman in the United States would have enough money for approximately 13 more months of childcare, 9 additional months of rent, 6 additional months of mortgage and utilities payments, the full cost of tuition and fees for attending a 2-year college, almost 7 additional months of premiums for employer-based health insurance, more than 8 additional years of birth control, more than 64 weeks of food, or enough money to pay off student loan debt in just under 3 years; Whereas women hold two-thirds of the Nation’s $1.54 trillion in outstanding student loan debt, totaling over $929 billion, and are less likely to be able to pay off their student loan debt promptly due to wage disparities; Whereas the wage gap impacts women’s ability to save for retirement and women’s total Social Security and pension benefits, and older women are more likely than men to live in poverty; Whereas sex discrimination in education, hiring, and promotion has played a role in maintaining a workforce segregated by sex; Whereas sex-based wage differentials— depress employee wages and living standards necessary for health and well-being; reduce family incomes and contribute to the higher poverty rates among women and their families; and prevent the effective and maximum utilization of available labor resources; Whereas a wage gap exists in nearly every occupational field, but opening traditionally male-dominated jobs to women and reducing occupational segregation by sex increases earnings for women; Whereas nearly two-thirds of workers paid the minimum wage or less are women and the concentration of women in low-wage jobs is a significant contributor to the wage gap; Whereas the gender wage gap between union women and men is about half the size of the wage gap between nonunion women and men, and women union members typically earn $212 more per week than women who are not represented by unions; Whereas as much as 38 percent of the wage gap is unexplained by observable factors such as variation in educational attainment, industry, and occupation, and may reflect discrimination; Whereas two-thirds of private sector workers report that employers either prohibit or discourage them from discussing their pay, which can keep the existence of pay discrimination hidden and prevent remedying that discrimination; Whereas the lack of family friendly policies, such as access to affordable, quality childcare, paid family and medical leave, paid sick days, and fair and predictable work schedules, forces many caregivers to choose between providing for their families financially and ensuring their loved ones receive quality care, and contributes to the wage gap; Whereas one in three women have been on the receiving end of sexual harassment during their careers, and an estimated 87 to 94 percent of those who experience sexual harassment never file a formal complaint; Whereas workplace harassment forces many women to leave their occupation or industry, or pass up opportunities for advancement, and this contributes to the gender wage gap; Whereas equal pay strengthens the economic security of families and enhances retirement savings; Whereas when women are paid fairly, families are stronger, businesses prosper, and American values and the economy are strengthened; Whereas if women in the United States received equal pay comparable with men, poverty for working women would be reduced by half and the economy would add $5.12 billion annually, based on a 2017 analysis; Whereas the economic fallout from the COVID–19 pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on women and women of color, with women losing the majority of jobs lost since March 2020; Whereas since women earn less on average than their male partners, three times more women than men have left the workforce to look after their children who are learning from home; Whereas women and women of color are now experiencing the lowest rates of employment in decades; and Whereas numerous national organizations have designated Wednesday, March 24, 2021, as Equal Pay Day to represent the additional time that women must work to compensate for the average 18 percent lower wages paid to women last year: Now, therefore, be it That Congress— recognizes the disparity between wages paid to women and men and its impact on women, families, and the Nation;
