<whereas><text>Whereas an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine argued that <quote>[u]ntil […] children physically return to school full time, many will lose out on essential educational, social, and developmental benefits; neither the economy nor the health care system will be able to return to full strength given parents’ caretaking responsibilities; and profound racial and socioeconomic injustices will be further exacerbated. We believe that safely reopening schools full-time for all elementary school children should therefore be a top national priority.</quote>;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has said <quote>[t]here is increasing data to suggest that schools can safely reopen and that safe reopening does not suggest that teachers need to be vaccinated” and “[v]accinations of teachers is not a prerequisite for safely reopening schools.</quote>; </text></whereas>
