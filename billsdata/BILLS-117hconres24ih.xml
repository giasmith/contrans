August 3, 2021, is Black Women’s Equal Pay Day; September 8, 2021, is Native Women’s Equal Pay Day; and October 21, 2021, is Latinas’ Equal Pay Day;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas if current trends continue, Asian women are projected to close the gender pay gap in 22 years, White women in 50 years, Black women in 350 years, and Latinas in 432 years;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the disparity in median annual earnings for women and men working full-time, year-round is $10,157; which can add up to more than $400,000 over a career;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas women’s median earnings are less than men’s at every level of academic achievement, with women with less than a high school diploma earning 72 percent of men’s earnings, and women with a professional degree earning 68 percent of men’s earnings at the same level of education;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas women are often paid less than men with lower levels of education, with women with associate’s degrees paid less than men with a high school diploma, and women with master’s degrees paid less than men with bachelor’s degrees;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas in the United States, mothers are breadwinners in nearly half of families with children under 18, and mothers working full-time typically are paid 75 percent of what fathers are paid;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the gender wage gap collectively costs women employed full-time in the United States more than $956 billion in annual lost wages, so that families have less money to spend on goods and services that help drive economic growth;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas if the annual gender wage gap were eliminated, on average, a working woman in the United States would have enough money for approximately 13 more months of childcare, 9 additional months of rent, 6 additional months of mortgage and utilities payments, the full cost of tuition and fees for attending a 2-year college, almost 7 additional months of premiums for employer-based health insurance, more than 8 additional years of birth control, more than 64 weeks of food, or enough money to pay off student loan debt in just under 3 years;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas women hold two-thirds of the Nation’s $1.54 trillion in outstanding student loan debt, totaling over $929 billion, and are less likely to be able to pay off their student loan debt promptly due to wage disparities;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the wage gap impacts women’s ability to save for retirement and women’s total Social Security and pension benefits, and older women are more likely than men to live in poverty;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas sex discrimination in education, hiring, and promotion has played a role in maintaining a workforce segregated by sex;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas sex-based wage differentials—</text><paragraph id="HC0AFBE86B99B4672B22426D0C5F8270F"><enum>(1)</enum><text>depress employee wages and living standards necessary for health and well-being;</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H2F7F81556F3549F78772A5F24B3D7E98"><enum>(2)</enum><text>reduce family incomes and contribute to the higher poverty rates among women and their families;
