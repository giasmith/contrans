RESOLUTION</legis-type><official-title display="yes">Condemning the October 25, 2021, military coup in Sudan and standing with the people of Sudan.</official-title></form><preamble><whereas><text>Whereas the people of the Republic of Sudan suffered for three decades under the despotic rule of President Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir, whose government was responsible for the suppression of civil liberties, grand corruption, support for international terrorism, and the commission of crimes against humanity and genocide;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, throughout 2019, a coalition of Sudanese civic groups, including professional associations, labor unions, community groups, democracy activists, and opposition parties, led a mass protest movement to demand the end of Bashir’s reign and the transition to democracy in Sudan;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on April 11, 2019, Sudanese military officers deposed Bashir, and, following continued protests, agreed to form a transitional government in partnership with a civilian pro-democracy coalition on July 17, 2019;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on June 3, 2019, Sudanese forces led by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), largely comprised of Janjaweed militia involved in genocidal campaigns across Darfur for decades, opened fire on protesters at an army command headquarters in Khartoum, killing at least 127 people, at least 40 of whom were found in the Nile River;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the military and civilian elements agreed to a 39-month transition to democracy, with a Civilian-Led Transitional Government (CLTG) comprised of a predominantly civilian cabinet led by Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok, a Sovereign Council, an executive body with civilian and military members chaired for the first half of the transitional period by Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and a Transitional Legislative Council, which has yet to be formed;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States and the international community supported Sudan’s transition to democracy, with the United States identifying more than $1,000,000,000 in foreign assistance, and the multilateral Friends of Sudan group pledging $1,800,000,000 from roughly 50 countries and international organizations;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the CLTG made progress in human rights reforms, including guaranteeing the people of Sudan freedom of religion and gender equality under the transitional constitution, banning female genital mutilation, and decriminalizing apostasy;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in August 2021, when the Sudanese Cabinet ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), the CLTG made progress towards ending impunity for abusers of human rights, stating its intention to deliver Omar al-Bashir to the ICC to stand trial for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, and formed civilian committees to investigate corruption and crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Bashir regime;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the transitional government negotiated a peace agreement with several rebel groups, a step towards ending decades of conflict in the regions of Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile, which killed hundreds of thousands of civilians and left more than 3,000,000 people displaced within Sudan;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Sudan continues to face a serious humanitarian situation, with an estimated 13,400,000 people, or 29 percent of the population, in need of humanitarian assistance in 2021;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Sudan faces a severe economic crisis, exacerbated by the COVID–19 pandemic, which caused the price of food and consumer goods to increase significantly, while austerity measures imposed to stabilize the economy resulted in the reduction or elimination of subsidies for commodities including wheat and fuel;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the political tensions between the civilian and military elements and within factions of the civilian coalition undermined the CLTG and contributed to widespread unrest within the Sudanese population relating to a range of issues, including the economic crisis, ethnic and tribal conflict in peripheral regions, and the unsatisfactory pace of reforms;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on September 21, 2021, some members of the military reportedly attempted a coup d’état against the transitional government, which failed to depose the government but succeeded in precipitating the most serious political crisis of the transition period;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on October 21, 2021, hundreds of thousands of people across Sudan demonstrated in support of democratic civilian rule, to counter a smaller protest days prior demanding the military take complete control of the government;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on October 25, 2021, Lieutenant General Burhan, with the support of General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as <quote>Hemedti</quote>, seized control of the government, deployed the military to the streets of Khartoum and Omdurman, and arrested and detained Prime Minister Hamdok and other civilian officials;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the African Union Peace and Security Council convened on October 27, 2021, strongly condemned the coup, reaffirmed the mandate of the CLTG, and subsequently suspended Sudan from the regional body <quote>with immediate effect … until the effective restoration</quote> of the CLTG;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the actions of Lieutenant General Burhan and the Sudanese military violate Sudan’s Constitutional Charter and threaten to plunge Sudan into isolation and instability;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Government publicly condemned the coup, suspended its foreign assistance to Sudan, and urged Lieutenant General Burhan and his accomplices to restore the CLTG and return Sudan to the path to democracy; and</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, the Troika (the United States, United Kingdom, Norway), the European Union, and Switzerland <quote>continue to recognize the Prime Minister and his cabinet as the constitutional leaders of the transitional government</quote> and <quote>confirm once again the international calls for the immediate return to the roadmap for democratic transition of Sudan</quote>: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble><resolution-body style="traditional"
